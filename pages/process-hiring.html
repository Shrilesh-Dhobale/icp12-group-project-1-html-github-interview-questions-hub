        <pre><h4>The process and hiring in an IT (Information Technology) interview typically follows a structured format, 
            especially for fresher and campus placements. Here's a breakdown of the typical IT interview process and what 
            you can expect:</h4><hr/><hr/>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Application Submission</h2>
    <p>
        The first step in the hiring process is submitting your application through an official career portal, company website, or job platforms like LinkedIn, Naukri, or Indeed.
        Your resume should be updated, highlighting your skills, projects, internships, and achievements. Make sure the cover letter (if asked) is customized to the company and job role.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Resume Screening</h2>
    <p>
        Recruiters or HR teams review your resume to determine whether you meet the basic qualifications and skill requirements. 
        This is usually done through automated software called ATS (Applicant Tracking System), followed by manual shortlisting. 
        Resumes with relevant keywords, clear formatting, and strong project/internship descriptions are more likely to get shortlisted.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Online Assessment (Aptitude + Technical)</h2>
    <p>
        Most companies conduct an online assessment as the next step. This test typically includes:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Aptitude Questions:</b> Logical reasoning, quantitative ability, and verbal ability.</li>
            <li><b>Technical MCQs:</b> Based on programming languages, databases, operating systems, data structures, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Coding Round:</b> Solve 1–3 programming problems using languages like C, Java, Python, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        This stage is used to filter out candidates based on problem-solving and technical knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Technical Interview(s)</h2>
    <p>
        After clearing the online test, selected candidates face 1 or more technical interviews. This can include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Core Subject Questions:</b> DSA, DBMS, OOPs, OS, CN.</li>
            <li><b>Coding Exercises:</b> Write optimized code on a whiteboard or compiler-based platform.</li>
            <li><b>Project Discussion:</b> Explain your internship/project work in detail.</li>
            <li><b>System Design (for experienced roles):</b> Discuss how you'd build scalable systems.</li>
        </ul>
        The interviewer will assess how well you understand concepts, solve problems, and communicate technical ideas.
    </p>

    <h2>5. HR/Managerial Interview</h2>
    <p>
        Once technical rounds are cleared, the final step is the HR or Managerial interview. It includes:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Behavioral Questions:</b> Tell me about yourself, strengths/weaknesses, leadership, conflict resolution, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Cultural Fit:</b> HR wants to see if you match the company’s work environment and values.</li>
            <li><b>Salary Discussion:</b> For experienced roles, salary expectations and notice period are discussed.</li>
            <li><b>Availability:</b> Joining timeline and willingness to relocate or work in shifts may be asked.</li>
        </ul>
        This round is to check your attitude, communication, personality, and alignment with the company.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Offer Letter & Onboarding</h2>
    <p>
        If you clear all rounds, the company will send you an offer letter via email or company portal. It includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Salary structure (CTC)</li>
            <li>Role and designation</li>
            <li>Joining date and location</li>
            <li>Terms and conditions</li>
        </ul>
        Once you accept, the onboarding process begins. You may receive documents to verify identity, education, and past experiences. After onboarding, you’ll attend an induction program followed by training or direct project allocation.
