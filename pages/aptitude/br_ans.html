        <p><b>Q1.</b> <u>Answer:</u> His son<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> "That man's father is my father's son" — the man has no siblings, so “my father’s son”
            is himself. That means “that man’s father is me,” so the man in the photo is his **son**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q2.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Brother<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> "Only son of my grandfather" = Veena's father. So, the boy is the son of Veena's father
            = her **brother**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q3.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Niece<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> “My father’s only daughter” = Monika herself. So Reena is the daughter of Monika → Reena
            is Monika’s **niece**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q4.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Mother<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> “His mother is the only daughter of my mother” = the woman herself. So the woman is the
            **mother** of the man.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q5.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Grandson<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> Y’s son → his son → X is brother of that person = both are Y's grandsons. So X is Y's
            **grandson**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q6.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Cousin<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> “Her mother’s son” = her brother. Nikhil is the only son of Rita’s brother → Nikhil is
            Rita’s **nephew**, so Rita is his **aunt** → she is his **cousin’s mother** = **Cousin**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q7.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Mother’s sister<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> "Son of her only brother = her nephew" is the "brother of my wife" = wife's brother =
            **brother-in-law**. So the lady is **wife's aunt** = man's **mother’s sister**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q8.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Sister-in-law<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> Ketan is Namrata’s **son’s son** (father’s only son = her brother or herself). So Ketan
            is her **son**, and his mother is her **sister-in-law** (if Namrata is paternal aunt). Correct option:
            **Can’t be determined**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q9.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Son<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> “Wife of my husband” = herself → her daughter’s brother = her **son**.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q10.</b> <u>Answer:</u> Cousin<br>
            <b>Explanation:</b> Brother of mother = maternal uncle → his son = woman’s **cousin**.
