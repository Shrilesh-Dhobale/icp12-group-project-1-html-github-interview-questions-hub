    <h3>1. Tell me about yourself.</h3>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in programming and software development.
        I have completed projects in web development and Java full stack, and I recently finished an internship 
        where I worked on a Medicine Tracking System. I’m passionate about learning new technologies 
        and building solutions that solve real-world problems.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What are your strengths?</h3>
    <p>
        My strengths include problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to work under pressure. 
        I am also a quick learner and a team player, which helps me adapt to new environments and collaborate 
        effectively on projects.
    </p>

    <h3>3. What are your weaknesses?</h3>
    <p>
        One area I am working on is public speaking. I sometimes feel nervous while speaking in front of large groups, 
        but I have been improving through presentations in college and participating in technical events.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Why should we hire you?</h3>
    <p>
        I have a solid technical background and a strong passion for software development. I am hardworking, 
        eager to learn, and dedicated to delivering quality results. I believe I can contribute to your team’s 
        success through my skills and enthusiasm.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>
    <p>
        In the next five years, I see myself as a skilled software developer, taking ownership of major projects 
        and helping mentor new team members. I also hope to expand my knowledge into DevOps and cloud technologies.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Describe a challenging project you worked on.</h3>
    <p>
        One challenging project was the Bank Locker Security System, where I integrated Python for face detection 
        with Node.js for backend processing and MySQL for data storage. Coordinating between different languages 
        and technologies taught me a lot about system integration and debugging.
    </p>

    <h3>7. What is your favorite programming language and why?</h3>
    <p>
        My favorite language is Java because of its object-oriented nature, strong community support, 
        and the availability of frameworks like Spring Boot which make backend development efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>8. How do you handle stress or pressure?</h3>
    <p>
        I handle stress by breaking down tasks into manageable steps, setting priorities, and staying organized. 
        I also take short breaks to stay focused and approach problems with a clear mind.
    </p>

    <h3>9. What motivates you?</h3>
    <p>
        Solving real-world problems through code and seeing my solutions in action motivates me the most. 
        I enjoy learning and improving my skills with each project I work on.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Do you have any questions for us?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, I’d like to know more about the team I’ll be working with and the types of projects I would be 
        involved in if I get selected. Also, what learning and development opportunities are available?
    </p>
